Cost Optimization
=================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

To control database costs in |service-fullname|, you can create billing
dashboards using |charts| to visualize billing data and monitor usage
across categories and time periods.

To prevent over-provisioning, you can enable auto-scaling on your cluster tier,
which adjusts resources based on usage.

To minimize data transfer costs, you can configure {+clusters+} with
same-provider, same-region transfers whenever possible.

To reduce resource consumption and lower costs, you can lower backup
frequency for less critical data, optimize queries, terminate {+clusters+}
in development environments, and configure alerts and review invoices in
the Cost Explorer in |service|.

Use the following resources to learn about cost optimization in {+service+}:
