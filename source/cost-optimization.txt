Cost Optimization
=================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

The Cost Optimization pillar of the {+service+} {+waf+} includes
features that help you control database costs in |service-fullname|.




Use the following {+atlas-arch-center+} resources to learn about cost
optimization in {+service+}:

   .. card::
      :headline: Cost-Saving Configurations
      :url: https://mongodb.com/docs/tbd/cost-saving-config/
      :icon: atlas_usage_based_pricing
      :icon-alt: Atlas usage-based pricing icon

      Enable auto-scaling on your cluster tier so that |service| automatically
      adjusts resources based on usage and prevents over-provisioning.
      To minimize data transfer costs, configure {+clusters+} with
      same-provider,same-region transfers whenever possible.

      Use billing dashboards to monitor usage across categories and time periods.
      To reduce resource consumption and lower costs, you can also optimize
      queries, terminate {+clusters+} in development environments, configure
      alerts, and review invoices in the Cost Explorer in |service|.
