The Security pillar of the {+service+} {+waf+} includes features that
ensure data integrity and privacy through comprehensive safeguarding
measures, such as encryption at rest and in transit, fine-grained access
controls, and adherence to regulatory standards.

Use the following {+atlas-arch-center+} resources to learn about
security in {+service+}:

      |service-fullname| enforces mandatory |tls| encryption for database connections,
      with TLS 1.2 as the default protocol. You can configure {+ip-access-list+}\s
      to restrict database access to specific IP addresses and |cidr| ranges and
      use private endpoints for staging and production projects.

      To control resource operations and improve security, you can use
      Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in |service| with built-in and
      custom roles. Implement RBAC with the principle of least privilege
      and integrate with identity providers in |service|.

      To protect and monitor data, |service| meets compliance standards and
      provides features for auditing and logging.
