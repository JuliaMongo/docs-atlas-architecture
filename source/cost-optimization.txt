Cost Optimization
=================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Cost optimization involves managing expenses while maintaining performance
and scalability. A data platform should provide clear visibility into resource
usage to help predict and manage costs effectively.
|service-fullname| offers comprehensive tools and features to control
database costs as usage expands, including user-friendly cost optimization
features to streamline spending.

You can create billing dashboards using MongoDB Charts to visualize billing
data and monitor usage across different categories and time periods.
To prevent over-provisioning, enable auto-scaling on your cluster tier,
which adjusts resources based on usage.

Consider lowering backup frequency for less critical data and terminating
clusters in development environments. Optimize data transfer by using same-provider, same-region transfers
whenever possible to minimize costs. Optimize queries to reduce resource consumption and lower costs, and use
tools like Cost Explorer to set alerts and review invoices for better cost management.
