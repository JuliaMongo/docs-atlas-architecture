.. default-domain:: mongodb

The Cost Optimization pillar of the {+service+} {+waf+} includes
features that help you control database costs in |service-fullname|.




Use the following {+atlas-arch-center+} resources to learn about cost
optimization in {+service+}:

      To prevent over-provisioning, enable auto-scaling on your cluster tier,
      which adjusts resources based on usage. To minimize data transfer costs,
      configure {+clusters+} with same-provider, same-region transfers whenever
      possible.

      To reduce resource consumption and lower costs, use billing dashboards
      to monitor usage across categories and time periods. You can also
      optimize queries, terminate {+clusters+} in development environments,
      configure alerts, and review invoices in the Cost Explorer in |service|.
