Improve performance of your deployments to achieve low latency and high
throughput for data operations, and to allow your deployments to scale
seamlessly to meet increasing demand.

To manage data processing fluctuations, maintain performance, and reduce
database costs as data usage grows, use automated scaling, tiered {+cluster+}
storage, and workload optimization in |service-fullname|. Configure
auto-scaling in |service| within predefined limits. |service| auto-scales
{+clusters+} in all tiers except the highest, and adjusts {+cluster+}
tier and storage capacity based on real-time workload demands for CPU
and memory utilization. For horizontal or vertical scaling options, you
can use deployment templates, and upgrade {+clusters+} to higher tiers
through the |service| UI.

To monitor and optimize query performance, you can use the Performance
Advisor in |service|. The Performance Advisor provides index recommendations
that allow you to efficiently retrieve data. To manage local and cloud
environments, and automate tasks and scaling resources as needed, use
the {+atlas-cli+}.

To learn about features that help you improve performance in {+service+},
see :ref:`Scalability <arch-center-scalability>`.
