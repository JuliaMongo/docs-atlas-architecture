.. default-domain:: mongodb

The Performance pillar of the {+service+} {+waf+} includes features, such
as automated scaling and tiered {+cluster+} storage, that allow your data
operations to achieve low latency and high throughput, and scale your
deployments to meet increasing demand.

Use the following {+atlas-arch-center+} resources to learn about performance
in {+service+}:

.. card-group::
   :columns: 2
   :style: extra-compact

   .. card::
      :headline: Scalability
      :url: https://mongodb.com/docs/TBD/scalability/
      :icon: TBD
      :icon-alt: Atlas scalability icon

      Use auto-scaling to dynamically allocate resources based on growing workload
      demands. For horizontal and vertical scaling, use {+service+} deployment templates.
      Monitor and optimize query performance with the Performance Advisor in |service|.
