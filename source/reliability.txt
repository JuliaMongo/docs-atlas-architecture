To achieve reliability, minimize downtime, and prevent data loss, use
|service-fullname| features for high availability and fault tolerance
and create {+cluster+} configurations that meet your availability needs,
security, and compliance requirements.

When you launch a new {+cluster+}, |service| configures a minimum three-node
replica set and distributes {+cluster+} nodes across availability zones
within your chosen cloud provider's region. |service| writes data to a
primary node and replicates it across secondary nodes. If a primary node
fails, |service| detects the failure, promotes a secondary node to primary,
and restores the {+cluster+} to its target configuration. You can add nodes
up to any odd total number of nodes as needed.

Use built-in tools to monitor cluster performance and integrate with
third-party services. Enable termination protection to prevent accidental
{+cluster+} deletion. Additionally, you can configure retryable database
reads and writes and configure database backup options in |service|.

Simulate disaster recovery scenarios to test your preparedness for such events.
