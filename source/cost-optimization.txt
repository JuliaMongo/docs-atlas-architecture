Cost Optimization
=================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

To control database costs in |service-fullname|, you can create billing
dashboards using |charts| to visualize billing data and monitor usage
across categories and time periods. To prevent over-provisioning, you
can enable auto-scaling on your cluster tier, which adjusts resources
based on usage.

For example, yu can consider lowering backup frequency for less critical
data and terminating clusters in development environments. To minimize data 
transfer costs, you can use same-provider, same-region transfers whenever
possible. To reduce resource consumption and lower costs, you can optimize
queries and use Cost Explorer in |service| to configure alerts and review
invoices.

Use the following resources to learn about cost optimization in
