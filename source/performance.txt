Performance efficiency ensures low latency and high throughput for data
operations while scaling seamlessly to meet increasing demand.

|service-fullname| supports automated scaling, tiered storage, and workload
optimization to reduce database costs as data usage grows. Auto-scaling
dynamically allocates resources based on real-time workload demands,
ensuring you only pay for what you use. You can configure auto-scaling
within predefined limits to manage data processing fluctuations, maintain
performance, and achieve cost efficiency. Atlas offers cluster auto-scaling
for all tiers except the highest, adjusting tier and storage capacity
based on CPU and memory utilization. 

Deployment templates provide horizontal and vertical scaling options, and
you can upgrade clusters through the control plane GUI.

|service| also includes tools like the Performance Advisor to monitor and
optimize query performance, offering intelligent index recommendations to
enhance data retrieval efficiency. The Atlas CLI helps manage local and
cloud environments efficiently, automating tasks and scaling resources
as needed, which supports local testing and development while minimizing
cloud usage.
