To achieve operational efficiency, implement automation to improve
process consistency and efficiency. Ensure full visibility into system
performance with real-time monitoring and observability. This approach
allows you to detect issues proactively and resolve them quickly to maintain
reliability. 

Use |service-fullname| integrations with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools to
automate resource deployment. Leverage CloudFormation Resources with
JSON and YAML templates available in the AWS CloudFormation Public Registry
to utilize various |service| resources. Additionally, you can automate
processes using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK), Atlas CLI,
Atlas Kubernetes Operator, and direct scripting via the Atlas Admin API.

Use the following resources to learn about operational efficiency
in {+service+}:
