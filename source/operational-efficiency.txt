To use consistent processes, monitor system performance in real time and
detect issues, automate resources deployment by integrating with
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools in |service-fullname|. For example,
you can use JSON and YAML templates from the |aws| CloudFormation Public
Registry, automate processes using the |aws| Cloud Development Kit (CDK),
the {+atlas-cli+}, the |ak8so|, and direct scripting via the {+atlas-admin-api+}.

Use the following resources to learn about operational efficiency
in {+service+}:

- :ref:`Automation <arch-center-automation>`
- :ref:`Monitoring and Alerts <arch-center-monitoring-alerts>`
