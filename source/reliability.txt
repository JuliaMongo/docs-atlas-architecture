Reliability

To achieve reliability, you can provide high availability and fault tolerance
to minimize downtime and prevent data loss. |service-fullname| allows you
to create cluster configurations that meet your availability needs
while satisfying security and compliance requirements.

When you launch a new cluster, |service| configures a minimum three-node replica
set across availability zones. If a primary node fails, |service|  detects the failure,
promotes a secondary node to primary, and restores the cluster to its target configuration.
You can increase the node count to any odd number as needed. |service| writes data to a
primary node and replicates it across secondary nodes. 

By default, |service| distributes cluster nodes across availability zones
within your chosen cloud provider's region.

Use built-in tools to monitor cluster performance and integrate with
third-party services. Enable termination protection to prevent accidental
cluster deletion. Additionally, |service| supports retryable database reads
and writes and provides robust database backup options.

Simulate disaster recovery scenarios to test your preparedness for such events.
