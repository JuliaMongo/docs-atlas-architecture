|service-fullname| ensures data integrity and privacy through comprehensive
security measures, such as encryption at rest and in transit, fine-grained
access controls, and adherence to regulatory standards.

|service-fullname| enforces mandatory |tls| encryption for database connections,
with TLS 1.2 as the default protocol. You can configure {+ip-access-list+}\s
to restrict database access to specific IP addresses and |cidr| ranges and
use private endpoints for staging and production projects.

To control resource operations and improve security, you can use
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in |service| with built-in and custom roles.
Implement RBAC with the principle of least privilege and integrate with
identity providers in |service|.

To protect and monitor data, |service| meets compliance standards and
provides features for auditing and logging.
