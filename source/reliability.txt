Reliability

.. default-domain:: mongodb

The Reliability pillar of the {+service+} {+waf+} includes features that
minimize downtime and prevent data loss, including support for high
availability and fault tolerance.

Use the following {+atlas-arch-center+} resources to learn about reliability
in {+service+}:

      :icon: mdb_high_availability
      :icon-alt: Atlas high availability icon

      Create {+cluster+} configurations that meet your specific availability
      needs while satisfying your security and compliance requirements.

      Use features in |service|, such as write concern and retryable database
      reads and writes to maintain database's uptime regardless of infrastructure
      outage and system maintenance. To prevent accidental {+cluster+} deletion,
      enable termination protection.

      :headline: Backups
      :url: https://mongodb.com/docs/TBD/backups/
      :icon: mdb_backup
      :icon-alt: MongoDB backup icon

      Configure database backup options in |service|, such as point-in-time data
      recovery, and create consistent, cluster-wide snapshots of all {+clusters+}.
      Store backups using native snapshots from your {+cluster+}'s cloud service provider.
